# Alogirthm Challenges

This is a collection of alogortihm challenges. I did not or claim to have written MOST of the code, it was mostly provided to me by my coding bootcamp. I  provided what I thought the output would be.

A list of problems that I wrote some code for:
Count positives - Conditionals.js
Reversing an array - Array.js
Consult the Oracles - The_Math_Library.js
Array of Objects Challenges - Objects.js
Nesting Arrays and Flatten Array - Nester_Arrays.js
