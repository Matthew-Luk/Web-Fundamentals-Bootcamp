# Web-Fundamentals-Bootcamp

In this repository it holds all my assignments from the front-end development portion of my bootcamp. We mainly focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A lot of the assignments were uploaded manually because I did not know how to use Git during this time but I don't plan on updating a majority of these assignments.
